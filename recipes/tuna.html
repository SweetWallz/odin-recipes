        <p><h3>The underrated tuna melt, that staple of diners and lunch plates everywhere, deserves to be making a big time comeback. First, it's as tasty as can be. Second, it's easy to make, and third, you probably have most of the ingredients in your fridge right now. What are you waiting for?</h3></p>

        <p><h3>We took that classic tuna salad and gave it a makeover with lots of fresh greens and herbs (celery, dill, scallions) and just the right amount — not too much — of mayo. Then we layered lots of grated Cheddar on top (so it'll melt), and topped it with a technique for pan-toasting bread that, as you can see, looks as good as it tastes.</h3></p>
