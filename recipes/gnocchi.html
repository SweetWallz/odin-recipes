        <p><h3>Gnocchi is a pillowy soft pasta that, if you aren't keeping in your pantry, you should be. And frozen spinach is a versatile and healthy ingredient that can be used so many different ways. Besides those two, all you need for this 10-minute meal is some cream, some cheese, and a few pantry spices.</h3></p>
